## Introduction
Hey, I'm [Caso](https://rec.net/user/Caso)! I've been creating in Rec Room for the better part of 2 years and I have used that time to refine my knowledge enough to begin accepting commissions. My scope of knowledge is pretty broad, but I really enjoy making circuits with a lot of user interaction (like an arcade machine, or custom user interface).

I've worked on a few different [rooms](https://rec.net/user/Caso/rooms):
* [GoldenHour.GoldenHourOG by jollybeannn](https://rec.net/room/GoldenHour)
* [DreamDen by Caso](https://rec.net/room/DreamDen/)
* [CampCozy2.0 by SodaSpill](https://rec.net/room/CampCozy2.0/)
* [FactoryTycoon.Arena by DORM](https://rec.net/room/FactoryTycoon)
* [FindTheButton by DORM](https://rec.net/room/FindTheButton)
  
  
I mainly accept payment via CashApp or PayPal.
