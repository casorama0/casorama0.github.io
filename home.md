### About Me
My name is Caso and I've been creating on a more advanced level for the better part of 1-2 years, though my interest for circuitry started a bit after I started the game 4 years ago. I have a passion for circuitry and generally creating user-facing systems. I love designing and implementing UIs and am capable of creating individual art assets for these UIs. 


### Rooms / Projects
